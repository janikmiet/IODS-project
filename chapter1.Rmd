### Quick thoughts


I've have used Git + rstudio for long time. I'm interested to see how this [MOOC course](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cur/hy-opt-cur-2122-6bc9901d-e80d-4ba7-8bce-829e42c15521) works and what kind of *platform* it has. **Super excited!** `r emo::ji("smile")`

My github repo for this project is located over here:

- <https://github.com/janikmiet/IODS-project/tree/master>. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## installing new packaes and adding emojis to text :D
# remotes::install_github("hadley/emo")
library(emo)
```
